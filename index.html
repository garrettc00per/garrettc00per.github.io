<p>I’m a PhD candidate in Genetics and Molecular Biology studying how genetic variation contributes to the development and progression of pediatric cancers. My research integrates functional 
genomics and multi-omics approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving tumorigenesis and to identify actionable therapeutic vulnerabilities. During my graduate training, I have employed  
deep mutational scanning to functionally characterize critical variants in SMARCB1, and used Wilms tumor models to demonstrate the potential of nuclear export inhibition as a therapuetic strategy. 
My work aims to bridge basic science and translational impact.<p>
 

Outside the lab, I create YouTube content about science, bioinformatics, and life in research. I enjoy spending time with my fiancée and our dog in Atlanta, usually outdoors and staying active.
