I’m a PhD candidate in genetics and molecular biology focused on how genetic variation drives pediatric cancers. My work combines functional genomics and multi-omics approaches to uncover mechanisms of tumor development and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities.

I’ve used deep mutational scanning to characterize critical SMARCB1 variants and utilized Wilms tumor models to highlight nuclear export inhibition as a potential treatment strategy. I aim to bridge basic research and clinical relevance.

Beyond the lab, I share ideas on YouTube about science, bioinformatics, and research life.
