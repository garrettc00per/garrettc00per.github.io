I’m a PhD candidate in genetics and molecular biology focused on how genetic variation drives pediatric cancers. My graduate research has centered on understanding how genetic variation contributes 
to pediatric cancers, leveraging functional genomics and multi-omics approaches to uncover tumorigenic mechanisms and reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities.

I’ve used deep mutational scanning to characterize critical SMARCB1 variants and utilized Wilms tumor models to highlight nuclear export inhibition as a potential treatment strategy. I 
aim to bridge basic research and clinical relevance.

Beyond the lab, I share ideas on YouTube about science, bioinformatics, and research life. I like to spend my free time with my fiance and dog in Atlanta, preferably doing something active!
