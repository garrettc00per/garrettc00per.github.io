Research Experience

**Hong Laboratory at Emory University**

Atlanta, GA

PhD Candidate

June 2021 - August 2025 (anticipated)

• Cultured patient-derived tumors to characterize loss and gain-of-function missense mutations in the tumor suppressor SMARCB1.

• Integrated diverse research methods including RNA-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, CUT&RUN, viral vectors, mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamic simulations to characterize mutational phenotypes.

• Experienced in sample and library preparation for both next generation sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

• Utilized Amazon Web Services, R, and Python to optimize and automate transcriptomic and epigenetic data analysis, ensuring reproducibility in data processing and interpretation.

**Assay Research Team at GRAIL**

Menlo Park, CA

Laboratory Research Intern

Jun – Aug 2024

 • Conducted a bridging study to transition the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) assay to a new platform, ensuring compatibility with commercial products while lowering cost.

 • Evaluated performance metrics of a novel WGBS internal assay chemistry compared to a previous kit-based method, identifying potential biases and confirming sequencing data integrity.

 • Delivered a formal presentation of findings to the entire research team, highlighting key insights and recommendations for assay optimization.

**Kissinger Laboratory at University of Georgia**

Athens, GA

Undergraduate Research Assistant

January 2018-May 2020

• Conducted variant analysis of ~250 genomes of the parasite Cryptosporidium to identify highly variable regions which we hypothesized may be driving host immune evasion.

• Leveraged publicly available genomic data and high-performance computing clusters to generate a scientific hypothesis through genome alignment and variant calling.

**Georgia Genomics and Bioinformatics Core**

Athens, GA

GGBC Intern

June 2018-August 2020

• Automated library preparation for 16s rRNA genotyping to accurately characterize diverse microbial populations using next-generation-sequencing.

• Optimized RNA purification and library preparation for Oxford Nanopore Direct RNA sequencing of the Dionaea muscipula (also known as the Venus fly trap) to detect isoform expression difference 
across various geographic regions.

• Handled sample submission and organization of long-term sample storage.
